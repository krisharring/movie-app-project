            Objective: To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
            application will provide users with access to information about different
            movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
            personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
        </p>

            Who—Your immediate users will be frontend developers who’ll work on the client-side for the
            application based on what’s been documented on the server-side (in this case, this developer
            is also you!). You should also consider the users of the myFlix application. These will be
            movie enthusiasts who enjoy reading information about different movies.
            ● What—The complete server-side of your web application, including the server, business logic,
            and business layers of the application. It will consist of a well-designed REST API and
            architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API
            will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods
            (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational
            way.
            ● When—Whenever users of myFlix are interacting with the application, the server-side of the
            application will be in use, processing their requests and performing operations against the
            data in the database. These users will be able to use the myFlix application whenever they like
            to read information about different movies or update their user information, for instance, their
            list of “Favorite Movies.”

            ● Where—The application will be hosted online. The myFlix application itself is responsive and
            can therefore be used anywhere and on any device, giving all users the same experience.
            ● Why—Movie enthusiasts want to be able to access information about different movies,
            directors, and genres. The server-side of the myFlix application will ensure they have access
            to this information, that their requests can be processed, and that all necessary data can be
            stored.
